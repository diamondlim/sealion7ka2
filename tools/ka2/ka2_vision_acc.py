"""Vision -> stock ACC setpoint: slow for a bend the model already sees, then hand the speed back.

The vision_turnspeed branch computes a deceleration request and gives it to the planner's MPC, which only
helps a car where openpilot works the pedals. This box has the stock ACC doing gas and brake, so the same
geometry is actuated the only way this car allows: move the ACC setpoint with the car's own buttons, one
5 km/h step at a time, through the same request file card consumes.

Geometry is lifted unchanged from selfdrive/controls/lib/vision_turn_speed.py on the vision_turnspeed branch
(path_curvature / find_bend / v_cap = sqrt(a_lat / kappa)) so the two agree by construction. What this file
adds is the actuation policy:

  * It lowers the setpoint with SET for a bend the model sees (5 km/h per press), and when the road ahead
    allows it again it raises it back with the car's own + pattern - **never above the setpoint the driver
    had before the first press**. That ceiling is the whole safety argument: this can undo its own work and
    nothing more. It never invents a faster target than the driver's.
  * It raises only when the road genuinely allows it: no bend within the lookahead, or the bend's comfort
    speed is at least one step plus a margin above the current setpoint. "Straight" is judged by geometry,
    not by the bend having disappeared for a moment.
  * It never presses ACC+ (RES) on its own, never LKAS, never CANCEL. RES alone cancels ACC on this car. The
    + pattern is only ever used while moving above the speed floor, because at a standstill it means
    resume/cancel.
  * It acts only while ACC is engaged and the car is moving above VIS_TURN_ACC_MIN_V_KMH.
  * At most VIS_TURN_ACC_MAX_STEPS presses down per bend, cooldown between any press, and never below
    VIS_TURN_ACC_MIN_SETPOINT_KMH. If the driver raises the setpoint themselves, that becomes the new
    ceiling and the books are cleared.
  * Shipped OFF: /data/hermes/tuning.json holds VIS_TURN_ACC_ENABLED = 0 until it is set to 1. Every tuning
    range is one-sided too - the file can only make this act LESS, never more.
